# Developer Documentation

*Converted from HTML to Markdown*

---

- We work in the Apps UX Council to create whatever guidelines pertaining to app development. We as the Apps UX Council own the guidelines internally, update our Confluence pages, and so on.
- If we want to add our best practices to the public*** ***Apps SDK docs (Apps builder documentation), then we need to submit a request to the Tech Writing team via a Jira ticket. 
- The [Apps SDK docs (Apps builder) documentation](https://developers.make.com/apps-builder-documentation/apps-builder-documentation) will live in Theneo, which is owned by the Tech Writing team, so the Tech Writing team has to make the updates.
- [@jendippel](https://integromat.slack.com/team/U05N5LKC3FG) will be the person updating the documentation in Theneo and will be the one assigned to whatever future Jira tickets, but, [@Ella Dombrovskaya](https://integromat.slack.com/team/U058D9H4X36) is the POC and all questions about processes, making requests, ideas, or general enquiries. 
- After we add our best practices to the public documentation, it will be the same process for requesting an update. A CXP Jira ticket.

The pages within this section contain best practices for writing text within apps, including hints and module descriptions COMING SOON, and naming conventions for aspects of apps, including modules and field labels.
For general writing practices for the Make product, refer to [Writing Guidelines](https://make.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GC/pages/1132134512/Writing+Guidelines). If information differs between the two sets of guidelines, the IEN guidelines below take precedent.
### Included best practices- [Writing: Hints](https://make.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IEN/pages/826016021/Writing+Hints)- [Templates: Universal Hints](https://make.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IEN/pages/913997919/Templates+Universal+Hints)- [Writing: Module descriptions](https://make.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IEN/pages/1700462605/Writing+Module+descriptions)- [Naming: Apps](https://make.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IEN/pages/1522368529/Naming+Apps)- [Naming: Modules](https://make.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IEN/pages/895975426/Naming+Modules)- [Naming: Input fields](https://make.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IEN/pages/1416331298/Naming+Input+fields)- [Naming: ID field with Map toggle](https://make.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IEN/pages/1172766721/Naming+ID+field+with+Map+toggle)

# IntroductionHints play a very important role in the overall usability of an app and well-written hints can have a significant positive impact on the user experience. When developing new apps and modules, it is essential to pay close attention to each field&rsquo;s hint. Follow this guide and the[ Apps UX Council Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/W6gA16FZ6f3qTnkdZRLM4m/Apps-UX-Council?type=design&node-id=1%3A45&mode=design&t=IFpAsIYblhrmNHxL-1) to ensure hints are both effective and consistent across all apps.
# Objectives- All fields that are not self-explanatory should contain a hint
Extra attention should be paid to Connection fields and their hints
- **Gmail: Create a draft** module **Subject** field does not need a hint
- **Gmail: Create a draft **module **Content **field may need a hint to specify that you can enter HTML tags
- All essential information is included
- The information is clear and concise 
- The terminology used is non-technical and easy to understand
- Avoid using symbols like ⨀ (circled dot operator)
# Information to includeThere are 6 categories of information that hints can include. Each hint can contain at least one of the information types, but can contain a combination of multiple. If multiple information types are included, they should be organized in the order listed below.
- Expected input
- Result
- Example
- Additional information
- What if left empty
- Link
| ****Information type**
** | ****What to consider**
** | ****Description**
** | **✅ **Do**
** | **❌ **Don&rsquo;t**
** 
| - Expected input
| What should the user enter?
| This will often be the description included in the API documentation.
If the description is not clear or is too technical, update it to be more user-friendly.
| Include a clear description of what to enter/select.
**Response format**
Format of the generated audio file.
| If possible, avoid using verbs at the beginning of the hint.
**Response format**

| - Result
| What will happen if the user enters a specific value?
| Include this information if it is useful to describe what will happen when users enter a specific value.
| Include a clear description of the outcome, especially if there are various possible outcomes.
**Temperature**
Higher values generate a more random response. For example, 0.8. Lower values generate a more focused response. For example, 0.2.
| Do not include the result if the outcome is obvious. 
| - Example *
| Would an example help the user understand what to enter?
| Include an example to provide more clarity, if specific formatting is used, or if it is valuable for users.
| Use the format &lsquo;For example, code formatting&rsquo;.
**Image URL**
URL address to a public resource of the image. For example, https://getmyimage.com/myimage.png.
| Do not use terms such as e.g., i.e., for instance, etc.
**Image URL**
URL address to a public resource of the image, e.g. https://getmyimage.com/myimage.png. 
| - Additional information
| Is there any other information that the user is required to know, or that is helpful? 
| Include any other information that is important for users. This can be supported formations, information users should include/leave out, etc.
| Include extra information the user must know to successfully use the field.
**Output file name**
Name of the generated audio file. Do not include the file extension.
| If the information is too long, include a link to the 3rd party resource or our Help Center instead.
| - What if left empty
| What happens if the user doesn&rsquo;t input anything?
| If something happens when the user leaves the field blank, include that information.
| Describe the impact of not entering a value.
**Format**
If left empty, default formatting is used.
| If an update module deletes values when a field is left empty, do not forget to include this information in a hint.
| - Link *
| Is there a link to our documentation or 3rd party documentation that would be helpful?
(If not already included)
| Help Center

## **Make an API call: URL field**### Introduction- The help message under the **URL** should contain the correct &ldquo;prefix&rdquo; path and an example &ldquo;postfix&rdquo; path of the URL.
- If possible, the **URL** field hint should include an example endpoint that works without performing any additional steps (for example, where no {body} is required).
- Use `GET` methods as the example endpoints. Do not use endpoints that create or delete records.
- Do not hardcode API versions in the prefix path, this ensures user can work with any API version. Even if there is currently only one version, future compatibility should be considered.
### URL field hint

# IntroductionWhen writing module descriptions for apps, it is important that users clearly understand what they can do with the module. Module descriptions should emphasize what a user can achieve with the module, not necessarily the process it takes to perform the task. If the API documentation for an endpoint does not align with this, do not use description of the endpoint, but follow the module description guidelines below and include the information there.
# Information to includeThere are 3 categories of information that the descriptions can include.
- End result - *mandatory*
- Restrictions/Requirements - *when necessary*
- Additional information - *when necessary*
| ****Information type**
** | ****Description**
** | **✅ **Do**
** | **❌ **Don’t**
** 
| - End result
| Clearly describe what the module achieves, using the templates in the section below.
| Include a clear description of the end result the module performs.
| Do not include unnecessary details on *how* the module performs the action if it is not relevant for users to know.
| - Additional information
| If there is any other additional information that provides clarity for the user regarding what the end result will be or specifics of the module, include that in the description.
| Include any other specifics that are useful for the user, such as the groups are in the same board or the format a document is downloaded in.
| Do not include unnecessary details that are not important for the user to know when selecting the module.
| - Requirements
| If the module has any requirements, such as a specific plan on the 3rd party or Make side, requires a certain settings on the 3rd party side, etc., include that information.
| Clearly state necessary requirements to define the eligible audience of the module.
| Do not include excessive information in module descriptions that can otherwise be placed in a banner in the module, a field hint, or in documentation.

- Introduction
- App names
- Internal tools names
# IntroductionThis document outlines the naming conventions to follow when naming apps or tools.
# App namesFor example: Google Chat, Instagram for Business, Google Ads Reports
- Always follow the brand guidelines
- When uncertain about naming conventions, use **Title Case**
- If app names require suffixes (e.g., "Reports"), use **Title Case** for the suffix
| **✅ **Do**
** | **❌ **Don’t**
** | ****Note**
** 
| Google Ads Reports
| Google Ads reports
| *Report *is a suffix and should be capitalized
| Instagram for Business
| Instagram For Business
| *for* is a preposition and should not be capitalized in title case
| X (formerly Twitter)
| X (Formerly Twitter)
| *formerly Twitter* is ‘additional information' and should follow [https://make.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IEN/pages/895975426/Naming+Modules#Additional-information](https://make.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IEN/pages/895975426/Naming+Modules#Additional-information) 
# Internal tools namesFor example: Personal Data (PII) Remover, Make AI Tools
- Naming internal tools will be handled on a **case-by-case basis** through team discussion to ensure clarity and relevance.

# IntroductionIt is important to use consistent formatting for module names throughout all apps. 
Each module’s name should precisely describe what the module does, containing the following:
- Verb: the action (Watch, Add, Create, etc.)
- Item: what is being processed (contact, message, user, etc.) 
Module names should adhere to the following rules:
- Start with the verb
- Use the plural form for the item in Watch and Search modules
- Use the singular form for the item in Action modules
- Use sentence-style capitalization (first word capitalized and the rest lowercase, other than proper nouns and acronyms)
- Stick to the American English variant for spellings by default. If the third-party service uses British spelling for specific product terms, adopt their style to ensure clarity and familiarity for the user.
- Always follow the naming conventions format below, and adjust for the terminology of the 3rd party
Exceptions:
In some cases, the 3rd party’s terminology will not be compatible with our naming conventions. It is important to stay consistent with the 3rd party’s terminology in those cases, and adjust our naming accordingly, using the same terminology that the user is familiar with from the 3rd party’s UI. For example, Custify uses the term *People*, and defines it as ‘individual users within your application’. As *people* is a plural item, not singular, our naming convention of using *a/an* before the item is grammatically incorrect. We do not change the terminology to fit our conventions, but instead remove a/an for the module name. ✅ UPDATE PEOPLE ❌ UPDATE A PERSON

- FAQs
# IntroductionIt is important that input field labels are clear and understandable for users. The following should be followed when creating input field labels:
- Give a short description (1–3 words) of the requested input.
- Should match the terminology that users see in the 3rd party’s UI, not the API documentation. 
- Be descriptive, not instructional. If the selection needs more explanation, include information in the help text below the field.
- Be written in sentence-style capitalization (the first word capitalized, the rest lowercase - see more details in Capitalization section below)
- Avoid punctuation and articles (“the”, “an”, “a”).
# CapitalizationSentence-style capitalization should be used for input field labels. This means only the first word in the label should be capitalized, and also the following:
- Proper nouns and trademarks: names of people, companies, products, or other proper nouns should remain capitalized. For example, the company name Microsoft would be capitalized.
- Acronyms: acronyms should be written in all capital letters, as in normal written text. For example, Content ID, File URL.
- Official terms: any term that is officially recognized or trademarked should retain its capitalization according to its standard usage. For example: Zap

# FAQsFor select fields, the label of the field should be dependent on whether the Map toggle is ON or OFF by default.
If the **Map toggle is ON **by default** **→ field label** should contain “ID”**.
If the **Map toggle is OFF **by default →  field label** should NOT contain “ID”**.
# For example:Map toggle is ON by default → label should be `Board ID`
Map toggle is OFF by default → label should be `Board`
- Types of fields
- Standard vs. Advanced fields
Standard fields

# Types of fieldsFor more examples, refer to the[ Apps UX Council Figma page](https://www.figma.com/file/W6gA16FZ6f3qTnkdZRLM4m/Apps-UX-Council?type=design&node-id=110%3A32&mode=design&t=Tkwuf6b5yhrM6AB2-1).
When organizing fields, there are 2 different classifications to consider: Standard vs Advanced and Required vs Optional. The image below shows where they are located/how they are identified in modules.
# Standard vs. Advanced fields## Standard fields- Visible be default
- Frequently used
- Typically easy to understand
- Visible on the 3rd party’s Web UI by default
- Consider copying UX from the 3rd party’s Web UI
- `Limit `should be the last variable
## Advanced fields- Hidden by the “Advanced settings” toggle
- Not needed by the majority of users
- Generally more difficult to understand 
- Can confuse or overwhelm the user
- Might require technical knowledge
A clear hint or link to documentation is necessary
- Includes Custom Fields, if supported by the app (JIRA, NetSuite)
- Hidden on the 3rd party’s Web UI
- Consider copying UX from the 3rd party’s Web UI
- Are placed at the bottom of all fields. This ensures that when users toggle on the advanced map, they can easily view them without being mixed in with regular fields.
- `Limit `should be the last variable
# Required vs. Optional fields## Required fields- Minimal required effort to make the module work
- Validate if the user has filled in all necessary fields required by the API call
- Guards against getting an API error from the 3rd party due to missing fields
- Ideally contain a default value
- If an advanced field, must contain a default value
## Conditionally required fields- Required based on condition, for example:
Either field A or field B is required
- The field is required only on create but not update in an **Upsert** module
- A clear hint is mandantory to explain the condition
- They should go after **Required fields** and before **Optional fields**
This could be an exception if the fields have to be arranged in logical blocks
## Optional fields- Not necessary for the API to work, but good to have
- Enrich UX by providing flexibility to the user to send all fields the API supports
# Nested parametersNever use **advanced **directive in the nested parameters
- Introduction
- Types
- Example: Dynamic Google connection messages
# IntroductionMessages provide additional necessary information, enhancing our product's user-friendliness and eliminating user frustration. It’s important that relevant modules have clear, effective messagesin order to communicate the necessary information.

# TypesThere are three distinct message types, each accompanied by a specific icon and guidelines for their appropriate usage. The **recommended length** of the message is **50 to 300 characters**.
**Information (blue)**: Conveys relevant information within the current app module.
{
"type": "banner",
"title": "This is an info",
"text": "Here is a description of info.",
"theme": "info"
}
**Warning (yellow)**: Directs the user's focus to essential information.
{
"type": "banner",
"title": "This is a warning",
"text": "Here is a description of warning.",
"theme": "warning"
}
**Danger (red)**: Demands the user's full attention, often for deprecated modules and critical messages.

there is a risk on using `html` parameters. We must stop using it. Please consider the info and warning `banner` element.
# Example: Dynamic Google connection messagesSince users with @gmail.com must reauthorize their `google-restricted` connection every 6 months, we need to give them a visible message of their connection lifetime on the module.
The dynamic connection lifetime message should be placed in the yellow (Attention type) info box. When the connection is expired, the message style changes to red.
Message body:

- ID finder results
- Template of ID finder
# IntroductionThe purpose of the ID finder is to allow users to identify items within a module by entering search criteria. The ID finder can either be the only search method for a field, or can be included in a list of multiple search methods. The ID finder window can either include a single search criterion (keyword or exact match) or multiple search criteria. There are specific guidelines to follow when implementing the ID finder, both within the module and the ID finder itself.  
# Module guidelines## GeneralWhen implementing the ID finder within a module, it is important to consider whether it is the only available search method to identify the item, or if there are multiple search methods. Regardless of the number of search methods, the ID finder button should always be labeled **ID finder**. 
If you are implementing the ID finder for a field that is not searching for an ID, for example **Dropbox > Watch files** module **File Path** field, the button should read **Finder** instead of **ID finder**.
## Single search methodIf a module contains only the ID finder as a search method, the name of the field should be the **[Item] ID **that is being searched for. 
- **[Item] ID **field names include:
**Campaign ID **- campaign to be updated
- **Employee ID **- employee record to delete

## Multiple search methodsIf a module contains multiple search methods, they should be listed in an **[Item]** **search method** dropdown. Replace **[Item]** with the name of item that is being searched for. 
- **[Item] search method **field names include:
**Spreadsheet search method** - spreadsheet to add a row to
- **Channel search method** - channel to send a message to
- **Record search method **- record to update
- Etc.
- **[Item] search method** dropdown options include:
Search by keyword (ID finder with keyword search)
- Search by [item] (ID finder with exact match search)
- Select by file path
- Select from list
- Enter manually
- Etc.

# ID finder guidelinesThe ID finder can include either one single search criterion (keyword or exact match) or multiple search criteria. It is important to note that the number of results the ID finder will return is limited both on the Make platform side and the app side. Because of this, we do not advise users to leave the search field empty to return all results, as this information can be misleading. 
The standard blue info box message should be used for all ID finders, except for in cases of Single search criterion: exact match. 
Only a limited number of results can be shown. If you don’t see the item you’re looking for, try more specific search criteria. 
## Single search criterion### Keyword search- The name of the search field should always be **[Search item] Keywords**.
**[Search Item] keywords **examples include:
**Channel name keywords**
- **Address keywords**
- Include the blue info box that instructs users to use more specific search criteria. In this case, that is a more specific keyword.
[https://www.figma.com/file/W6gA16FZ6f3qTnkdZRLM4m/Apps-UX-Council?type=design&node-id=1040%3A483&mode=design&t=H3CRCzwG8RgpNnur-1](https://www.figma.com/file/W6gA16FZ6f3qTnkdZRLM4m/Apps-UX-Council?type=design&node-id=1040%3A483&mode=design&t=H3CRCzwG8RgpNnur-1) 
### Exact match required- The name of the search field should be identical to the name of the item that the user must match.
For example, if a user must enter an item’s name, the field should be **Name**.
- Do not include the blue info box that tells users to use more specific search criteria, as there are no other criteria or way to make an exact match more specific.
- In the search field hint, add the following: Must be the exact **[Search item]**.
For example: 
Field: **Channel name**. 
- Hint: Must be the exact **Channel name**.  
- Include any other necessary information in the search field hint, following the best practices for [Writing Hints](https://integromat.atlassian.net/l/cp/3Mu1oeBm).

## Multiple search criteria ### Keyword search- The name of the search field should always be **[Search Item] keywords**
**[Search Item] keywords **examples include:
**Spreadsheet keywords**
- **Employee Title keywords**
- Include the blue info box that instructs users to use more specific search criteria. In this case, that is either a more specific keyword or utilizing the other criteria in the ID finder to refine their search.

# IntroductionWe should **always **parse datetime in the module output with the following **exceptions**:
- No date, only time. For example, `13:30`.
- No time, only date. For example, `2024-01-01`.
- With both date and time, but no time zone. For example: `2020-06-08 12:37:56`.
Unless the API documentation specify the given datetime is in UTC or some other time zone.
- We should not use the Make user’s time zone or the Make organization’s time zone, because they may be different from the time zone configured in the 3rd party services.
- Timestamp in seconds or milliseconds. 
Unless it has a clear indication by it’s name, in the API documentation or metadata endpoints that shows such fields are a `Date` type field. **DO NOT** try to parse timestamps by assuming lengthy number must be a timestamp.
This should be applied **ONLY **to a new app, new app version or new modules. **DO NOT** change any datetime parsing logic in any existing app, as this changes the behavior and introduce breaking changes to scenarios.

Monday
# IntroductionWe should define the error handler for specific HTTP error type, if
- the error message is not user friendly, or
- no error message at all, or
- API docs list the error we would expect (e.g. Monday [https://developer.monday.com/api-reference/docs/errors](https://developer.monday.com/api-reference/docs/errors) ), or
- API support special type of error, for example **429 Too many requests**.
# Common HTTP error types we encountered## 4xx: Client Error4xx error indicate something wrong on our side
| ****Type**
** | ****Description**
** 
| 400 Bad Request
| The HTTP request that was sent to the server has invalid syntax.
| 401 Unauthorized
| The user trying to access the resource has not been authenticated or has not been authenticated correctly.
| 403 Forbidden
| The user is authorized, but lacking of some permissions to access the requested resource.
| 404 Not Found
| Wrong URL, or the ID not found if it is passed as a path parameter.
| 409 Conflict
| The request conflict with the current state of the target resource. For example, updating an outdated record.
| 418 I'm a teapot
| This error is a reference to Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol defined in April Fools' jokes in 1998 and 2014.
| 429 Too Many Requests
| The user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time ("rate limiting").
## 5xx: Server Error5xx error indicate something wrong on the 3rd party service
| ****Type**
** | ****Description**
** 
| 500 Internal Server Error
| The server cannot process the request for an unknown reason.
| 502 Bad Gateway
| The server is a gateway or proxy server, and it is not receiving a valid response from the backend servers that should actually fulfill the request.
| 503 Service Unavailable
| The server is overloaded or under maintenance. This error implies that the service should become available at some point.

# IntroductionTo enhance the usability of the app, on some cases we should consider combining multiple calls in a single module. There are two categories of action:
- **Read**Action that **WILL NOT** alter records in 3rd party services. For example: get a record, search for records, download a file…
- **Write**Action that **WILL **alter records in 3rd party services.For example, create a record, update a record, upload a file…
Due to the limitation of our platform, we should avoid combining multiple **Write **actions to a single module, with some exceptions.
It is easy to get confused by the action and HTTP verbs (e.g. GET, POST, PUT, …). Some services are not RESTful and they might use POST for **Read **action. For example: SOAP API, GraphQL API.
# Limitation of our platformConsider a scenario: The `Create a User` module creates a user, and you want to enhance the module by adding the ability to also create the address and attach to the created user. This involves 2 API calls:
- Create an address
- Create a user with the address ID
When the user run the module, the first call to create an address succeed but unfortunately the second call failed because there is an existing user with the same email. The module shows an error message on user creation failed and this is **misleading**, this should be a **partial success** instead but our platform does not support it.
In this scenario, we should create two separate modules so user can set up the error handling directive on individual module.
# Common batch actionThe following examples are great user experience improvement by batch action.
## Create or Update a record (Upsert action)- Module actions
If ID provided not found or no ID provided: `Create`, otherwise 
- `Update`
- Required fields
Required fields for `Create` should now be `Conditionally Required`
- For more information, please visit [https://integromat.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IEN/pages/900826760/Types+of+Fields#Conditionally-required-fields](https://integromat.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IEN/pages/900826760/Types+of+Fields#Conditionally-required-fields) 
- Empty mappings
Empty mappings should be ignored and not sending in the request, the same as `Update a Record` module. 
Chain of actions: Write (If API support upsert) / Read → Write
- Search records by ID
found → update
- not found → create
### Example- Salesforce: Upsert a Record
## Update by PUTSome services accept only PUT request for update, where
- PATCH update only the field provided, and
- PUT replace the whole object
On Make, we expect empty fields to be ignored, not erased.
Chain of actions: Read → Write
- Get record by ID
- PUT the record patched by user’s input
### Example- HighLevel LeadConnector: Update a Contact
## Get the record after updateSome service only returns an ID after record update. We should get the updated record and output it.
Chain of actions: Write → Read
- Update the record
- Get the record by ID
### Example- Workday Financial Management: Update a Supplier Invoice
## Upload a file### Upload in chunksChain of actions: Write → Write → … → Write
This is an exception to the rule that combine multiple **Write** actions. These requests are designed to be used in sequence.
- Create an upload session
- Keep sending chunks
- Finalize the upload
### Example- Dropbox: Upload a File
## Download a file### Download by media IDChain of actions: Read → Read
- Get the media ID
- Download file by media ID
### Example- WhatsApp Business Cloud: Download a Media
- Telegram Bot > Download a File
## Async processRequests involve process running asynchronously on 3rd party service.
Chain of actions:  Write → Read → Read → … → Read 
- Start the task
- Keep polling for task status
- Get the result when done
### Example- Microsoft Power Automate: Trigger a Desktop Flow
- Introduction
- Do and Don’t
# IntroductionWe should provide the dynamic parameters for custom fields, not asking the user to map the array even if the create / update endpoint accepts custom fields as array in the request body.
**Exception**: Some API does not provide the metadata endpoint, for example Zoho Books.
[https://www.zoho.com/books/api/v3/custom-fields/#overview](https://www.zoho.com/books/api/v3/custom-fields/#overview) This could be an exception to the rule.

- Introduction
- Do and Don’t
# IntroductionUse `date` type parameter instead of asking user to input a specific date format according to the API.
# Do and Don’t
| **✅ **Do**
** | **❌ **Don’t**
** 
|  |  
**Exception**
If the endpoint accept date only or time only, we must use `text` type parameter with a clear hint and example.
- Introduction
- Our approach
- Example
Custify - Get a Tag
# IntroductionSometimes there are situations when the API returns status code 200 without errors to an incorrect request. This can happen, for example, if the **Get a ...** module is developed based on the Search endpoint and not based on a separate endpoint (sometimes separate endpoint for that action is not implemented on the service’s side).
# Our approachExample of Search approach for Get module:
{
"url": "/items",
"method": "GET",
"qs": {
"id": "{{parameters.itemId}}"
},
"response": {
"output": "{{body.items[1]}}"
}
}
That is not great and since it is a Search endpoint, it can return just an empty response in case of wrong ID is provided, and to avoid letting users get empty responses it is important to validate the call’s response and if it is empty then return formatted error message. This can be achieved by adding “**valid**“** **to **response** object.Example of Search approach with valid:
{
"url": "/items",
"method": "GET",
"qs": {
"id": "{{parameters.itemId}}"
},
"response": {
"valid": {
"condition": "{{body.items[1].id}}",
"message": "Item with the given id does not exist."
},
"output": "{{body.items[1]}}"
}
}
In this specific case we mark response as invalid if it has no ID, as ID should always be returned with other data.Plese notice, that approach will trigger error handler from the Base, so make sure you have meaningful error messages there.
# Example## Custify - Get a Tag[https://docs.custify.com/#tag/Tag/paths/~1tag~1%7Bid%7D/get](https://docs.custify.com/#tag/Tag/paths/~1tag~1%7Bid%7D/get)Although the endpoint is `GET /tag/{id}`, it does not return a single item but a `tags` array in the response. It does not throw any error if there is no such tag ID.
**Communication**
{
"url": "/tag/{{parameters.id}}",
"method": "GET",
"response": {
"valid": "{{length(body.tags) === 1}}",
"error": {
"message": "[{{statusCode}}] {{body.error.message || body.message || body.error || 'Something wrong. Please try again.'}}",
"200": {
"message": "Tag not found."
},
"503": {
"message": "[503] Invalid tag ID."
}
},
"output": "{{body.tags[]}}"
}
}
To make it consistent with the behaviour of our conventional `Get` module, we should
- mark the response as invalid, if there is no such tag with the provided ID, and
- have a clear error message if the ID provided is not in the expected format.
We should use the following logic for the order of groups and modules:
- TRIGGERS
all instant triggers
- all polling triggers
- Generic modules (mostly for SoR apps)
if possible, sorted in groups
- for example RECORDS
- Typical modules divided by business logic
sorted in groups (for example TASKS, DEALS, CONTACTS)
- groups are sorted from the most important to the least important
- order by RCUD logic (read, create, update, delete)
- OTHER
for example, Make an API call, Execute a GraphQL query etc
| **✅ **Do**
** | **❌ **Don’t**
** 
|  |  
**Example of order of groups:**
- TRIGGERS
- FORMS
- TASKS
- DEALS
- OTHER
**Example of the order of modules in a group:**
FORMS group:
- List Forms
- Get a Form
- Create a Form
- Update a Form
- Delete a Form

# IntroductionDeeply nested outputs give terrible UX when user is mapping the values.
**Bad example of output:**
We should always consider
- creating a mappable version of the key-value pairs, and
- flatten unnecessary nested collections.

Examples of module description
# IntroductionBulk action is a single call, that can act on multiple records. For example, we can create/update/delete multiple records in a single call.
If the API supports bulk actions, we should always consider supporting bulk actions too (having a Bulk module). 
**Limitations**
Our platform does not support partial success status. If the module shows green (success) and, some of the actions failed, it confuses the user. In this case, we **SHOULD NOT** implement bulk actions.
# How to use bulk modulesUsers will have to create an array of records and they map this array in the Bulk module:
# For DEV/QA- In the Bulk module UI, the mapping should always be turned ON by default.
- Types of output:
If the API response returns a single success / fail -> `Action` module
- If the API response returns an output bundle of success / fail for individual record -> `Search` module
- If possible, Bulk modules should output the updated range/rows
# Bulk modules naming conventionBulk modules should always start with “Bulk” and contain (advanced):
If possible, the module name pattern is: `Bulk {action} {parameter} (advanced)`
### Examples of module names`Bulk upload call conversions (advanced)`
`Bulk create folders (advanced)`
# Bulk modules module descriptionIf possible, the module description pattern is: `{Action} multiple {parameter}`
### Examples of module description`Uploads multiple Google Ads call conversions.` 
`Creates multiple folders.` 
# IntroductionTo avoid module timeouts, in some cases, we have to increase the module timeout limit. The maximum timeout value is 5 mins (300000 ms). 
# ExamplesIncrease the timeout limit is typically needed in cases when we do the following (or any other, data demanding) actions:
- Download/upload large data files (for example, video files, high-resolution image files, graphic design templates, etc.)
Example: Youtube: Upload a video
- Sending large requests to be processed
Example: OpenAI: all modules
- The server response was too slow
Example: Salesforce: Update a record, Get a record
# LinksFor more information about Module timeout see the [Apps development documentation](https://make.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IEN/pages/267157505/Module+timeout).
The page size should be as large as possible, to 
- reduce the number of requests, and
- minimize the delay, and
- avoid hitting the rate limit
for better UX.
# Example## Activecampaign[https://developers.activecampaign.com/reference/pagination](https://developers.activecampaign.com/reference/pagination)
| **Parameter
** | **Description
** 
| `limit`
| The number of results to display in each page (default = 20; max = 100).
| `offset`
| The starting point for the result set of a page. This is a zero-based index. For example, if there are 39 total records and the `limit` is the default of 20, use `offset=20` to get the second page of results.
In this case, we should set `limit` to 100 in the request.
# Productive[https://developer.productive.io/index.html#header-pagination](https://developer.productive.io/index.html#header-pagination)There you can see the following:
current_page - 1 by default or the value you put in page[number]
total_pages - total_count/page_size rounded up
total_count - total number of resources you have
page_size - 30 by default or the value you put in page[size]
max_page_size - **200**
So we should do **200 **per page.
{
"qs": {
...,
"page[size]": "{{min(200, parameters.limit)}}"
},
...
}
Implement polling trigger only if the results
- consist of either a **numeric ID** or a **date** as the identifier
- the results could be sorted or default to **desencding order**
Try **NOT** using `unordered` or `asc` in polling trigger as we have the 3200 pagination limit. The trigger will stop working beyond the limit as new items cannot be reached.
[IEN-6403](https://make.atlassian.net/browse/IEN-6403?src=confmacro)
# ExceptionIf the API accepts filtering and get results only after a certain numeric ID or date, this could reduce the number of items we get and not request items from the very beginning. In this case, we could consider implementing the polling trigger.
